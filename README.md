# Futuree.io Codebase
The official codebase of the futuree.io game.

## About
Attempted my own rendition of a .io game, but thought it best to instead contribute to suroi.io. But who knows, maybe I will come back in the future? Also I would say it has a pretty good setup for anyone looking for a simple baseline to build their own little .io game off of. :D
