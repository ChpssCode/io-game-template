# Io Game Template

## About
Attempted my own rendition of a .io game, but thought it best to instead to contribute to another similaie surviv.il remake project called suroi.io, but who knows, maybe I will come back to finish my game in the future? Also I would say it has a pretty good setup for anyone looking for a simple baseline to build their own little .io game off of. :D
